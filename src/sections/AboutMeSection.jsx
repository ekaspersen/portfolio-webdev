                            Hello there! i am a
                            <span className="text-2xl">ü¶Ñ</span>
                            Unicorn developer. This means that i can not only;
                            develop/build web-applications, but also i have some
                            experience with and a strong passion for
                            ux/web-design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I tell more about my coding experience in the
                            education section. When it comes to design i am
                            mostly self-taught/YouTube, but I hope my designs
                            can speak for themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Collaborating with team members is one of the
                            aspects I enjoy most. I've found that I can often
                            help to keep the team spirit high with my outgoing
                            personality, and I believe that a motivated team is
                            key to successful projects. I am very excited to get
                            to collaborate on projects with more people
                        </p>

                            important to keep in order, therefore when i am not
                            working on or learning code/design i am usually
                            going to the gymüèãüèº or doing some social
